				<p>Yut Nori is a game where four pieces of one team move on a board with 29 dots, having thrown four yut (sticks made of wood used as the dice) to be the first to escape from the board. The combination of the four yut sticks, whether they are facing up or down after a throw, determines sawi (how many spaces the pieces can be moved). When three yut sticks land right side up and one lands upside down, it is called do, and a piece can move one space. Two yut sticks landing upside down while the other two land right side up is called gae, which allows a piece to move two spaces. One yut stick landing right side up while three land upside down is called geol, and a piece can move three spaces. If all yut sticks land upside down, it is called yut and a piece can move four spaces. Lastly, all yut sticks landing right side up is called mo, allowing a piece to move five spaces. Both yut and mo are referred to as sari, rewarding an extra turn. Pieces can be moved separately or together, and the team that is the first to escape from the board wins.</p>
				<p>Each sawi is interpreted in connection with an animal. Do means pig; gae, dog; geol, goat (sacred horse, or elephant); yut, cow; and mo, horse. Most researchers agree on the interpretation of do, gae, yut, and mo, while there are various interpretations of geol.</p>

				<blockquote>Yutnori is a game that has a very strong aspect of fortune-telling function along with the aspect of play. In terms of fortune-telling function, there are Pyeonyut, which predicts the good and bad luck of the year through the results of play, and Yutjeom, which predicts individual luck. Pyeonyut is mainly divided into village units to play yutnori, and the result of the play determines the well-being and abundance of the village. Pyeonyut in Jangyeon, Hwanghae-do, is called "Daegiyutnori," and it is divided into mountain parties and field parties to compete for victory. If the mountainside wins, the field farming will be successful, and if the field side wins, the rice paddy farming will be successful, and if both sides get similar scores, both rice paddy farming and field farming will be successful. </blockquote>
